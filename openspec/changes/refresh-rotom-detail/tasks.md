## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Update Rotom detail view to use the landscape Rotom shell frame (matching home/results bezel).
- [ ] 1.2 Restructure detail content into three blocks: left (description, vitals, abilities), middle (name/types + primary artwork), right (base stats).
- [ ] 1.3 Ensure responsive behavior (desktop-first Rotom landscape, graceful stacking on narrow widths).
- [ ] 1.4 Align visual treatments (glow, gradients, borders, typography) with the Rotom theme.
- [ ] 1.5 Add/adjust tests or stories if present to cover the new layout.
